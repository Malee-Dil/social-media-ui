# Responsive Design Implementation Plan

## Overview
Make all pages fully responsive by enhancing CSS/SCSS files with improved media queries and layout styles. Only CSS/SCSS files will be modified.

## Files to Edit
- [x] src/style.scss - Review and enhance mixins if needed (existing mixins are sufficient)
- [x] src/pages/home/home.scss - Improve padding and layout responsiveness
- [x] src/pages/profile/profile.scss - Enhance profile page layout for mobile/tablet
- [x] src/components/navBar/navBar.scss - Improve navbar responsiveness
- [x] src/components/leftBar/leftBar.scss - Enhance left sidebar responsiveness
- [x] src/components/rightBar/rightBar.scss - Improve right sidebar responsiveness
- [x] src/components/post/post.scss - Make post component responsive
- [x] src/components/posts/posts.scss - Enhance posts container responsiveness
- [x] src/components/stories/stories.scss - Improve stories component responsiveness
